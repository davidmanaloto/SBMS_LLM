# SBMS_LLM
Repository for Smart Building Management System Large Language Model

# Tools:
Ollama
A platform for running and managing open-source large language models (LLMs) locally. It simplifies the setup and execution of models, serving as a runtime environment for various LLMs.

LangChain
An application development framework designed to streamline the integration of large language models (LLMs) with external data sources, computation, and other software components. It facilitates the creation of complex LLM-powered applications.

Pandas
A fast, powerful, and flexible open-source data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides data structures like DataFrame to efficiently analyze, clean, and prepare raw data for use in applications, including those involving LLMs.

ChromaDB
An open-source vector database designed for storing, indexing, and querying vector embeddings. It is specifically optimized for similarity search and retrieval, serving as a back-end for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. While it can run in-memory, it is also capable of persisting data to disk.

Embedding
The process of converting a discrete input, such as text, into a dense vector of floating-point numbers. This numerical representation captures the semantic meaning of the text, allowing computers to process and understand relationships between words or documents. This process is also known as vectorization.

Nomic-embed-text
A specific text embedding model designed for generating embeddings. It is optimized for use on CPU-only devices, making it suitable for local, resource-constrained environments when integrated with tools like Ollama.

Data Format
The structured layout in which data is organized and stored (e.g., CSV, JSON, TXT). This format dictates how data is parsed and interpreted by tools like Pandas for manipulation and by embedding models for conversion into numerical vectors.
